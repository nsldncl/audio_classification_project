# audio_classification_project
## How to run file:
1. Install all the libraries from requiremnets.txt by command "pip install -r requirements.txt"


2. To run the above code we just need to run __init__.py file which will run other 2 python files i.e. create_dataset.py and transform_1.py. If you want to create dataset i.e. npy file for audio data than give 'Y' other wise give 'N'.

# audio_classification_project
## how to run file:
There are 2 python files one containing the code for our model and second contains code to generate data for our model. First of all we need to generate data for our model, so we need to run data_generate.ipynb file.

Than after we have to run second file i.e. audio_classification_1.ipynb this will train our model and give us output in form of captions.

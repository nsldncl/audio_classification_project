# audio_classification_project
## How to run file:
There are 2 python files one containing the code for our model and second contains code to generate data for our model. First of all we need to generate data for our model, so we need to run dataset_creation.ipynb file.

Than after we have to run second file i.e. audio_captioning_final(1).ipynb this will train our model and give us output in form of captions. And this file requires 3 more file that are used for traininig our model. This other files are also present in our repository.
